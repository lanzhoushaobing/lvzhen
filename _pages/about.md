I am a master's student who graduated from the [School of Internet of Things](https://ciot.njupt.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/). My research interest includes spoken signal, audio signal and machine learning.

I was very fortunate to be advised by Assoc. Prof.Xinzhou Xu from [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.njupt.edu.cn/).
